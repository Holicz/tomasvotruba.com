    Today I'm starting a new post series - *Cleaning Notes*. These post are for people, who are [aspiring legacy migrators](/blog/2020/06/29/how-will-programming-look-like-in-2025/) with vision to improve private PHP code ecosystem and bring joy to coding with gigantic applications again. The same vision we have in Rector team.

    In this series, you can learn about my experience, tricks, tips, what works and what fucked me up. So you can save some frustration, where is not needed, and discover hidden shortcuts.
